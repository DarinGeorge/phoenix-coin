# Phoenix Coin - Solana

This project was a bounty project found on Layer 3's Discord.

The task was to create a Coin/Token on the Solana Blockchain.

## Notes from Darin

After starting this project, I plan on expanding into a Multi-Minter that can mint tokens
on multiple chains and with multiple providers so it has officially become a work in progress!

Thanks for checking it out!
